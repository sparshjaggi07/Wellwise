## Project Overview
*Well Wise* is an AI-driven healthcare platform for mental health detection and depression management, leveraging Machine Learning, Generative AI, and OpenCV for enhanced accuracy. It integrates ML algorithms for assessment, GenAI for personalized insights, and OpenCV for real-time emotion tracking. A comprehensive dashboard summarizes user data, helping track mental health trends. By combining these technologies, Well Wise ensures a precise, data-driven approach to mental health evaluation.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** HTML5, React.js, Tailwind, CSS
- **Backend:**  Flask, Python
- **Machine Learning:** Scikit-learn, OpenCV
- **Blockchain & Smart Contracts:** Solidity, Ganache
- **Storage:**  Ganache (Local Ethereum Blockchain)
- **API:**  Flask REST API, Gemeni API

## Features
- User-friendly interface for document uploads.
- Automatic document type verification using AI/ML.
- Text extraction from documents using OCR.
- Secure storage of documents on IPFS with unique hashes.
- Dashboard for users to view document verification status.
- Manual verification request functionality.
- Future integration for companies to access verified documents via API.

## Workflow
The platformâ€™s mental health detection system is a standout feature, consisting of a four-section test designed to assess if a person is suffering from depression:

1. **History:** Questions about past experiences, childhood trauma, and mental health history to provide context for potential mental health challenges.
2. **PHQ-9:** The widely recognized Patient Health Questionnaire-9, a standard assessment tool for diagnosing depression and gauging its severity.
3. **Sentiment Analysis:** Analyzes text responses from the user, assessing emotional tone and sentiment to detect signs of depression.
4. **Computer Vision:** Uses webcam-based analysis of facial expressions during video responses, detecting potential signs of depression through changes in facial behavior.
5. **Analysis Dashboard:** The user can view their overall analysis report at the end of the session, considering various factors to generate the result.


## Future Plans
- Develop a counselor-driven model for mental Health detection and prevention.
- Improve the ML and OpenCV model for better accuracy in real-time analysis of users.
- Enhance the user interface and integrate new technologies to improve the overall accuracy of the project.
